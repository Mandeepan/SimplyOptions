## SimplyOptions

SimplyOptions is a platform streamlining private share trading with secure API integrations. It allows existing shareholders (e.g., former employees of the private company) to list their shares, it also allows investors or potentail buyers to post their offer. The platform also provide admin panel for issuers(company representative) to approve or reject transactions with full access to all historical transactions.
